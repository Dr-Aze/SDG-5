    <h2>What is SDG 5?</h2>
    <p>
      Sustainable Development Goal 5 aims to create a world where everyone — regardless of gender — has equal rights, opportunities, and respect.
      It focuses on ending all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, ensuring that they can live freely, make their own choices, and reach their full potential.
      Gender equality is more than a goal; it is the foundation for a peaceful, fair, and sustainable society.

    <h2>Why Gender Equality Matters</h2>
    <p>
      When women and girls are empowered, communities grow stronger. Gender equality boosts education, strengthens families, and improves economies.
      Around the world, women continue to face challenges such as unequal pay, limited education, and underrepresentation in leadership.
      SDG 5 calls on everyone to take action — to close these gaps and build fairness for all.

    <h2>What We Can Do</h2>
    <p>
      At our school, we can help achieve gender equality by promoting respect, fairness, and inclusion.
      We can speak up against stereotypes, support women-led projects, and celebrate each other's achievements.
      Every action — big or small — helps build a community where everyone belongs.
